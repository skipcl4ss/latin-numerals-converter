# latin-numerals-converter
#### A program written in C to convert between latin numerals (I, V, X etc..) and decimal numbers

This program takes the argument that the user have written, tests whether the input is a decimal number, a latin numeral, or neither. Then converts one type to another.
I may add new features later.

I will start soon inshallah.
